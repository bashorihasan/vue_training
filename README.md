# Vue.js Training

A comprehensive Vue.js training project with practical examples covering fundamental to advanced concepts.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This training repository provides hands-on examples for:

1. **Getting Started** - Data binding, interpolation, and attribute binding
2. **Event Handling** - v-on directive, event modifiers, and key modifiers
3. **Conditional Rendering** - v-if, v-else, v-show directives
4. **List Rendering** - v-for directive, working with arrays and objects
5. **Two-Way Binding** - v-model directive for forms and inputs
6. **Computed Properties** - Reactive derived data and caching
7. **Watchers** - Responding to data changes asynchronously
8. **Components Basics** - Creating reusable components
9. **Component Props** - Passing data to child components
10. **Component Events** - Child-to-parent communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bashorihasan/vue_training.git
cd vue_training
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your browser to access the training examples.

Alternatively, you can simply open `index.html` directly in your browser without running a server.
